# Engineering Security Tools With a Touch of Humor

I'm Jan (but everybody calls me `kober`) — a frontend developer with more than **10 years of experience** building security-focused software (mostly in banking, where the apps must be friendly but the rules are not 😅).

Although I occasionally build full applications, my main focus is on **SDK development** — creating secure, reliable building blocks that other developers depend on (and hopefully don’t curse too much).

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- Develop and maintain **security-focused SDKs**  
- Occasionally build applications using those SDKs (dogfooding is a lifestyle)  
- Lead a **small team of developers** on a daily basis  
- Interview developer candidates and help shape the team  
- Communicate with customers and handle **technical support** for the products I develop  
- Manage and maintain CI/CD pipelines across different environments

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

### Platforms I actively develop on
- **iOS**  
- **Android**  
- **Flutter**  
- **React Native, Cordova**  
- **Web (React/CSS/HTML)**  

### Languages I use regularly
- **Swift**, **Kotlin**, **Typescript**  
- **Java**, **Objective-C**  
- **C**, **C++**  
- **Bash** (for all those mysterious scripts nobody wants to touch)

### CI/CD & DevOps experience
- Azure DevOps  
- Jenkins  
- GitHub Actions  
- TeamCity  

## Totally Real and Absolutely Authentic Recommendations

> **“Jan once fixed a race condition by just staring at the code until it felt ashamed and corrected itself.  
> 10/10 would let him review my PRs again.”**  
> — *Definitely Not a Backend Developer*

> **“Our SDK had 327 issues. Jan touched it once, and suddenly it had only 326 issues. Incredible progress.”**  
> — *Senior Architect of Unknown Purpose*

> **“Working with Jan is like having a senior developer, support engineer, and stand-up comedian all in one.  
> He explains complex things simply, jumps in to help anytime, and somehow keeps the team laughing during production outages.”**  
> — *Developer that is no longer working with Jan*
